\title{Five-Dimensional Flow in Solid\\ Fuel Rocket Engines\\
       -- Fun with \LaTeX}

\begin{abstract}
  Solid fuel rocket engines are one of the most reliable and
  efficient propulsion systems used to lift payloads into orbit, in
  terms of $\lambda=(\Box+\Diamond)\psi$. Used throughout the
  astrodynamics community, the theory of the flow within the motor
  chamber is in fact a black art which defies all attempts at
  analysis.
	
  The present work (no exception to the statement above) contains a
  theoretical and numerical approach to the flow of the gases within
  the motor chamber. The shape of the chamber and original fuel
  configuration, and the patterns of combustion and flow/expulsion
  of gases, are modelled by a system of thirty fourth-degree
  differential equations.
  \begin{displaymath}
    f_i^{(34)}(x,y,z,t) = 
    \sum_{j=0}^{33} a_{ij} f_i^{(\mathrm{j})}(x,y,z,t)
  \end{displaymath}
  Acceptable numerical solutions would require one thousand pentium
  processors working day and night for $10^{11.2}$ years.
